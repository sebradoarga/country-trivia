<h1 align="center">Country Trivia - An API-Connected Website</h1>

This is a project I developed while taking part in the _Integrify International Academy Fullstack Program_. I built this website around the _REST Countries API_, to display all the countries in the API as a sortable and searchable table. The user can also navigate to individual country pages where additional information about a specific country is displayed.

This website is fully responsive and styled entirely from scratch with CSS and _styled components_.

## Overview

### The assignment

For our Front-End Module at Integrify, we were tasked with developing a website to display the data provided by the REST Countries API. For the task, we were required to use React, Typescript, and Redux.

### Features

These are some of the features of my project:

- Sortable (based on country name and population size) and searchable table
- Light & Dark mode
- Countries can be favorited and save in Favorite Cart
- Individual pages for each specific country
- Full responsiveness (including the table, which adjusts the amount of shown information based on window size)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

### Styled with

- CSS
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

### What I learned

This project served as great practice for working with an API and ensuring responsive design for tricky elements. For example, the main page table proved to be a design challenge at first, especially as I didn't want to rely on any already styled components for this project. Getting it to behave properly on different devices was challenging, but the process taught me a lot and increased my confidence in my skills.

It was also a valuable opportunity to familiarize myself with Redux.
